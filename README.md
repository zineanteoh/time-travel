## Time Travel

A simple editor that lets you "time travel" through your writing history. See every change you've made and play it back.

This entire repository is coded by AI. I wrote 0 lines of code.

Time: 1 hour.

Every week, [@kohrachel](https://github.com/kohrachel/) and I give ourselves an hour to create a goofy project solely with AI. No human coding, any idea you can think of.
