WHen coding: 
- Prefer react components written in export default function() {...} rather than FC
- Prefer not to do `React.Blablabla`, but instead use `Blablabla` directly. 
- ALWAYS HAVE self explanatory code without comments!
- NEVER ADD COMMENTS "//". REMOVE THEM
- Think about how best to design the app. Reference "The Deisgn of Everyday Things" book by Don Norman.
- MINIMIZE USNIG useEfffect!! THIS IS BAD PRACTICE. Many things can be implemented without useEffect. THINK EXTRA HARD IF YOU NEED IT

Keep it simply stupid (KISS) principle
